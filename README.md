# CNNs-Sentiment-Analysis-Semantic-Similarity-using-TensorFlow-Keras
This repo talks about Convolutional Neural Networks, Sentiment Analysis and Semantic Similarity using Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras API
Built a sentiment analysis model using Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras API and fed the dataset into neural network containing Bidirectional LSTM layers and visualized the output of LSTM layers using TensorBoard with accuracy of 87%
Implemented and fine-tuned a BERT model along with transformers to predict the sentence semantic similarity that takes two sentences as the input and outputs a similarity score between the two sentences with an test accuracy over 90 %
Explored Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGG16 and MobileNet to predict the labels of images from the ImageNet and MobileNet dataset with an test accuracy of 98 % in both the models and visualized it using confusion matrix
